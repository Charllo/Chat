# Using the client:

 + Starting the program:
   - Input the server IP
   - Input the server Port
   - Input the name which you want other people to see when you send a message

 + Press enter or the send button to send message

---

# Using the server

+ Run the server .py file:
  - Run with argument `-p $port` for a custom port, otherwise 5640 is used
  - Run with argument `-n $name` for a custom server name, otherwise "TCP Server" is used
    * `-n` can only (currently) be used if you also provide `-p`

# Notes

The files in CLI are command line versions (not tested completely, possibly unstable).
